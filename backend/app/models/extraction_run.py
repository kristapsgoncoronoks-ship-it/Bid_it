"""Extraction lineage for received invoices (Slice 5b of the data model).

One row per capture attempt at the `parse_invoice_file` choke point: HOW an
uploaded document was read (method), whether it parsed, the source (filename +
content sha256), and how many line items / warnings it produced. Created at
UPLOAD time (server-authoritative — the client can't forge it) with no invoice
yet; LINKED to the invoice when the reviewed draft is saved. A run whose
`invoice_id` stays NULL is a parse that was never saved (an abandoned upload or a
failed parse) — itself useful provenance.

Tenant-scoped (org_id + RLS + ORM guard). The link is a composite FK
`(org_id, invoice_id) → invoices(org_id, id)` — cross-tenant-safe — with ON
DELETE CASCADE, so an invoice's lineage is removed with it (a NULL invoice_id row
is simply not FK-checked).
