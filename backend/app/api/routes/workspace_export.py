"""PROD-009 — the whole-workspace data export.

Three doors, and no public way to ASK for one. WO-AI's archive export has an
unauthenticated email form because an ex-client's login is gone by definition;
this export is a live tenant's ENTIRE dataset, so requesting one requires being
signed in as an owner of that workspace, and the only thing that fetches one is
the single-use link emailed to that owner's own address.

- `POST /workspace/export` — owner only, 202, coalesced for an hour.
- `GET  /workspace/export-requests` — the request log; status only, never a link.
- `GET  /workspace/export/download/{token}` — the one-time link from the email.
  Unauthenticated BY THE TOKEN, which is an `EmailToken` (hashed, single use,
  seven days, issued to that owner): a used, expired, purged or unknown one is
  the same opaque 404. Served inert (attachment + nosniff) like every other
  stored byte.
