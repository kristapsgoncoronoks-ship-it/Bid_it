"""Transport routes slice 6 — the off-invoice rebate registry (WO-84, G4.2/R50).

`BA_fleet_fuel.md` §4.2's second discount tier arrives on a document no
fuel-card statement parser ever sees: *"Q8 invoices at **LIST price** per
country; Port One issues a **SEPARATE rebate invoice per country**. The pair
must always be reconciled."* This surface is how that second document gets
RECORDED, which is the only way a euro is ever allowed to reach `net_eur_eff`
(R50's *"guard the input source"*).

WHAT THIS SURFACE DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO
------------------------------------------
It cannot change a transaction. `POST` writes the rebate REGISTRY only; the
recompute of `fuel_transactions.net_eur_eff` is a CLOSE stage
(`close.run_close` → `rebate.merge_period`), because an already-validated
transaction's derived figure is product data the ENGINE owns and a web request
must not mutate it (`BA_fleet_fuel.md` §3.H, the engine ↔ app write boundary).
There is therefore no "merge now" verb here, by design — recording a rebate and
then closing the period is the whole flow.

It also cannot state the euro. `RebateIn` has no `amount_eur` field: the server
resolves it through `fx.to_eur` at the document's own date and REFUSES when the
ECB cache has no rate (§4.10, §4.15). A client supplies a document, never a
converted total.

Thin controllers ONLY (engineering-rules §3), the WO-76/WO-77/WO-81/WO-82
pattern: parse → structural permission gate → call the already-gated service →
shape the response. Every refusal a client can see (`module_not_enabled`,
`invalid_period`, `invalid_country`, `rebate_source_required`,
`rebate_amount_invalid`, `fx_rate_unavailable`) is raised BY THE SERVICE as an
`app.core.errors.AppError` and rendered by the one `app.main` handler as
`{"detail", "code"}` — this module maps nothing, so the wire vocabulary cannot
drift from the service layer (master-context §4.20).

AUTHORIZATION (ADR-0024, structural)
--------------------------------------
Router-level **`TRANSPORT_READ`**; the write verb overrides to **`VAT_WRITE`** —
identical to `overcharges.py`, and for the same reasons that module states at
length: `TRANSPORT_READ` is the permission `fuel.py` reserved for the derived
analytics slices, and `VAT_WRITE` is this codebase's ONE transport write
permission. `VAT_SUBMIT` is deliberately NOT used: recording a rebate acquires
and releases no invoice LOCK on a VAT claim and touches no VAT figure — the
rebate layer is a PRICE concern, not a refund one. **No permission member is
added** (§10).

THE PRICE BASIS
-----------------
A rebate is a component of the NET EUR/L, final basis (§3.G G1: *"VAT excluded,
rebates applied"*). This surface serves the rebate DOCUMENT rather than a price,
so it states no €/L of its own; the basis is stated where the price is served
(`overcharges.py`'s `price_basis`, and both WO-83 artifacts).
