"""Transport routes slice 4 — statement INTAKE, the front door (WO-S).

WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG
------------------------
`app/services/transport/statement_ingest.py` has existed since WO-62 and is
the only way a fuel-card statement can become `fuel_transactions` rows. Until
this module, **no route imported it**: seven shipped network parsers (Eurowag,
E100, Q8, DKV, TFC, Moeve, BP — WO-62…65, 67, 68, 69), the nine-rule capture
review gate (WO-66/R25), the deterministic post-capture checks (WO-71/R26) and
the anti-drift extraction baseline (WO-70) were all reachable only from a
Python prompt. A product whose data can only be loaded by its own authors has
no front door, and everything downstream of it — claims, the close, the
recovery board, the reliability board — was standing on a step nobody could
climb.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS, AND IS NOT
---------------------------------
Thin controller (engineering-rules §3): resolve → security-gate the bytes →
call the already-gated service → shape the reply. It adds no parsing, no money
arithmetic, no idempotency logic. Every refusal a client sees is raised BY THE
SERVICE as an `app.core.errors.AppError` and rendered by the one `app.main`
handler, so this module maps nothing and the wire vocabulary cannot drift
(master-context §4.20).

THE NETWORK IS NEVER A PARAMETER
----------------------------------
`fuel_card_parser.select` detects the network from the file's own marker line
and raises when none matches — "fail-closed network detection", its words. A
route that let the uploader assert `network=eurowag` would hand an operator a
way to have E100 bytes parsed as Eurowag, which is precisely the
miscategorisation that design prevents. So there is no network field here, and
`GET /networks` exists to tell the screen what is supported rather than to give
it something to send back.

AUTHORIZATION
---------------
`GET /networks` is a read of the registry: router-level `VAT_READ`. The upload
is a WRITE — it registers fuel transactions and teaches the supplier-entity
registry — so it overrides to `VAT_WRITE`, matching every other transport
mutation (ADR-0024, structural; no permission member added, §10).

THE FILE IS UNTRUSTED, AND IS TREATED THAT WAY
------------------------------------------------
`filesec.check` runs on the bytes BEFORE the parser ever sees them, allowing
`csv` only — every shipped parser reads UTF-8 CSV with a marker first line, so
a wider allow-list would only widen the attack surface without enabling a
single real statement. Size is checked first (413), then kind + content + the
malware scan (415). This is the same intake choke-point discipline as the bank
statement and invoice upload paths; a renamed script does not become a
statement by acquiring a `.csv` extension.

THE BYTES ARE KEPT (WO-AF)
---------------------------
Until WO-AF the upload digested the file, keyed every finding, baseline and
audit event on that digest — and then dropped the bytes. A review finding
pointed at a document that no longer existed, so "which line failed" could
not be checked against the file it came from. The statement is now vaulted
through `documents.store` (prefix `statements`, content-addressed, tenant-
prefixed, registered in the document catalog) BEFORE ingestion, so a refused
statement is kept too — the refusal is exactly when the operator needs the
file. `GET /{sha}/file` serves it back, inert, to anyone with `VAT_READ`, and
is audited like every other original's download.
