"""WO-AI — the PUBLIC half of the ex-client archive export.

An ex-client's owner has no login ("no live login is retained" — owner
decision 2026-08-16 §1.C), so both doors here are unauthenticated:

- `POST /archive/export/request` — the owner's address. Always answers
  `{"sent": true}`; whether the address is an owner's of any workspace is not
  revealed (the forgot-password posture). Requests for the same address are
  coalesced for an hour, so the form cannot flood an inbox.
- `GET /archive/export/download/{token}` — the one-time link from the email.
  The token is an `EmailToken` (hashed, single use, seven days); a used,
  expired or unknown one is an opaque 404. The zip is served inert
  (attachment + nosniff) like every other stored byte.
