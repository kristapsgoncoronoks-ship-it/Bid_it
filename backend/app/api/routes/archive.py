"""The platform archive — the CLIENT's own view of it.

`docs/design/platform-archive.md`. When an invoice's 30-day recycle bin expires,
the row is destroyed and a copy lands in the archive. The owner's decision is
that the client's own company owner can still see it there, for the retention
period, and download the source document.

That decision is what makes the archive defensible. A store clients cannot see
is retention done TO them and has to be explained; a store they can read is a
feature they use, and "your records are kept for N years and you can look at
them" is a sentence that goes in a DPA and an onboarding screen.

READ-ONLY. There is no restore-from-archive route and there should not be: the
bin restores into live books, the archive only shows. Pulling a three-year-old
invoice back into the ledger would reopen a closed accounting period and can
collide with invoice numbers issued since.

Router-level `ARCHIVE_READ`, which is held by OWNER and ADMINISTRATOR and by no
other business role. An archive holds the records a client believes they deleted;
"anyone who can read invoices" is the wrong audience for it.
