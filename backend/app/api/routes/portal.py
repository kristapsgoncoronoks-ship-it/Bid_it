"""The PUBLIC client portal (WO-I): the customer's magic link opens this.

Unauthenticated by design — the per-customer secret token IS the credential
(PUBLIC_ROUTES-listed with that reason; the calendar-feed precedent).
Tenant resolution mirrors the email-intake webhook exactly: an UNSCOPED
token lookup, then every query runs under the resolved tenant's explicit
scope, and an unknown/revoked token 404s with nothing to enumerate.

Serves ONLY the token's customer: their live offers (viewing stamps the
quote-viewed signal), their issued invoices with status, and the project
documents someone explicitly shared. The offer decision rides the one
existing transition machinery — accepted/declined from here is the same
event as from inside the app, audited with the portal actor.
