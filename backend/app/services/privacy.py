"""GDPR right-to-erasure (Art. 17) — DSAR handling that respects the law's own
limits (ADR-0020).

Erasure is NOT an unconditional delete. Art. 17(3)(b) exempts data a controller
must keep to meet a legal obligation, and an active **legal hold** (preservation
duty) overrides erasure entirely. So a request keyed by a data subject's email
resolves each personal-data location to one of:

  • erase   — pseudonymise / delete the personal data now,
  • retain  — deliberately kept for a statutory / integrity reason, reported,
  • blocked — a legal hold is active; nothing is erased until it is released.

What we do per location:
  users            → pseudonymise (email→erased token, name redacted, deactivated);
                     the ROW stays so audit attribution + FKs remain intact.
  expenses         → redact the author name on that person's expense reports.
  inbound_email    → delete the raw inbound record + its stored attachment bytes.
  issued_invoices  → RETAIN: issued tax invoices are statutory records (buyer
                     identity is required content); erasure is exempt.
  audit_trail      → RETAIN: the hash-chained trail is a tamper-evident integrity
                     record; redacting it would break the chain.

Every executed erasure is audited as `privacy.erasure` with a HASHED subject
reference + per-location counts (never the cleartext email or any raw value), so
we prove the request was handled without re-storing the subject's identity.
