"""Built-in job handlers. Importing this module registers them with the queue.

Kept separate from `jobs.py` (the queue mechanics) so the queue has no dependency
on any particular domain. `app.main` imports this at startup; the worker imports
it too, so both the API (which enqueues) and the worker (which runs) agree on the
set of known kinds.
