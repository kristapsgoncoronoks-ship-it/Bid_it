"""Fuel-card statement ingestion (G3.2 slice 1) — the ONE service function
that turns a raw statement file into `fuel_transactions` rows (G1.2,
`fuel_ingest.ingest_transaction`) and learned per-country seller entities
(G3.1, `supplier_entity.learn_registration`). This is the real caller both
of those functions have been waiting for: `fuel_ingest.ingest_transaction`
(WO-50) and `learn_registration` (WO-61) each shipped with "no real caller
yet" — this module is that caller.

TWO-PHASE WRITE: RESOLVE EVERYTHING BEFORE TOUCHING THE DATABASE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
`ingest_statement` resolves EVERY line's EUR figures (§4.15's FX
convention) in a first pass, entirely in memory, before calling
`fuel_ingest.ingest_transaction` for any of them. A statement with 40 lines
where line 37 cannot be converted (no cached ECB rate for its currency on
its date) therefore writes ZERO rows, not 36 — "nothing partially applied"
without depending on a job-framework rollback wrapper this order does not
have (unlike `close.run_close`, which gets that guarantee for free from
`jobs.run_once`; see that module's docstring). This mirrors
`app.services.expenses.build_items`' own behaviour: it loops calling
`apply_item_fx` per item with NO try/except, so one unconvertible foreign
item aborts the whole report build — the established codebase precedent
for "a batch of money lines is all-or-nothing on FX", not "skip the bad one
silently".

FX PROVENANCE
--------------
EUR-currency lines are the identity conversion (`fx_source="eur"`, no ECB
rate involved). A non-EUR line converts via `app.services.fx.to_eur` at the
line's OWN `txn_date` — never a guessed/blended rate — and BOTH `net_local`
and `vat_local` convert using the SAME resolved rate (one ECB lookup per
line, not two; the platform's ECB convention divides foreign units by the
rate to reach EUR). No cached rate for that (currency, date) ⇒ `to_eur`
returns `(None, None)` ⇒ `ValidationError(code="fx_rate_unavailable")` —
never a stored NULL (`fuel_transactions.net_eur`/`vat_eur` are NOT NULL)
and never a guessed number (master-context §4.15 verbatim).

THE SUPPLIER-STATED-EUR BRANCH (WO-65/G3.2 slice 4 — DKV's money model)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A parser whose network's harvested money model is "trust the supplier's
per-line EUR" (DKV: `BA_fleet_fuel.md` §5.1 "trusts the supplier's
per-line EUR and pro-rates") carries that figure in
`ParsedFuelLine.stated_net_eur`. For such a line the STATEMENT DOCUMENT is
the conversion's source of truth — the same `FxSource.stated` convention
`app.services.expenses.apply_item_fx` already ships ("the claimant stated
the converted amount... record the implied rate so the conversion is fully
documented", ADR-0010): `net_eur` is the stated figure AS GIVEN (never
recomputed via ECB — the invoice is what a refund state audits against);
`vat_eur` is PRO-RATED at the same implied basis (`vat_local *
stated_net_eur / net_local`, pure Decimal, the harvested "and pro-rates"
clause); `fx_rate` records the implied APPLIED rate (`net_local /
stated_net_eur`, foreign units per 1 EUR — `BA_fleet_fuel.md` §4.2's own
definition of the applied-rate column, quantized to the storage column's
6 dp); `fx_ecb_rate`/`fx_ecb_date` freeze the OFFICIAL reference rate
BEST-EFFORT when the cache has one (R56: both the applied and the official
rate frozen per line, so drift is auditable) and stay NULL when it does
not — a stated line NEVER fails on missing ECB coverage ("no coverage ⇒
NULL is stored, never a fabricated pass", §4.2 verbatim), which is the
observable difference from the ECB branch. Fail-CLOSED guard: an implied
rate that is not strictly positive (a zero `net_local`, a zero
`stated_net_eur`, or a sign flip between them) is refused with
`ValidationError(code="fx_stated_inconsistent")` in phase 1 — a
nonsensical implied rate would poison the pro-rated VAT figure that feeds
the claim, so the whole statement writes zero rows (the existing two-phase
guarantee, unchanged).

THE CAPTURE REVIEW GATE (WO-66/G3.3 — R25's first regime)
------------------------------------------------------------
After parsing and BEFORE any FX resolution, the parsed batch passes
through `capture_review.review_statement` — the harvested nine-rule
verdict lattice plus the optional batch tie-out against the invoice
coversheet total (`coversheet_total`, the figure printed on the statement
document, captured by the operator; `None` = no coversheet figure, the
tie constraint simply does not apply). `can_commit=False` (any ERROR
finding, or a tie-out off by more than €0.02 on quantized Decimals)
refuses the WHOLE statement with `code="capture_review_blocked"` before a
single row is written — fail-CLOSED, and deliberately placed ahead of the
FX machinery so the refusal names the actual capture defect ("net must be
> 0") rather than a downstream FX symptom (`fx_stated_inconsistent`).
WARN findings NEVER block (§2.1a verbatim) — they append to
`StatementIngestResult.warnings`, the review surface of this slice.

THE ANTI-DRIFT EXTRACTION BASELINE (WO-70/G3.3 slice 2 — advisory)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A statement's FIRST fully successful registration records its parsed
per-currency aggregates (line count, q2'd net/vat totals in LOCAL
currency) as the known-good `fuel_extraction_baselines` row set, keyed
by the content's SHA-256 (`BA_fleet_fuel.md` §2.1a "Anti-drift"). A
LATER ingest of the same bytes COMPARES instead of re-recording: net or
vat moved by MORE than 0.02, a changed line count, or a changed
currency set appends an "extraction drift: ..." WARNING — never a block
(the harvested verb is "flags"; §4.19 advisory semantics — see
`extraction_baseline`'s module docstring). This matters doubly here
because `ingest_transaction` is insert-or-no-op on the natural key: a
drifted re-parse writes nothing, so the drift warning is the ONLY
visibility that the parser no longer reproduces the registered figures.
The record/compare step runs AFTER phase 2 + entity learning — a
statement refused by the capture gate or FX resolution leaves no
baseline (only a CONFIRMED extraction is known-good).

WHAT "FLAGGED FOR REVIEW" MEANS IN THIS SLICE
------------------------------------------------
This codebase has no fuel-statement review-queue table yet (that is a
FUTURE slice — see the work order's "Out of scope"). A parse failure or an
FX-conversion failure raises (a hard refusal an eventual worker/route will
catch and record, exactly how `app.services.extraction.extract_upload`
already catches `parser.parse_invoice_file`'s `ValueError` and marks the
`ExtractionRun` `failed` — this order does not build that wrapper, since no
`api/routes/transport/*` route or worker kind consumes fuel-card statements
yet). A parser-level AMBIGUITY that is NOT fatal to the transaction figures
(e.g. no seller entity detected in the footer) surfaces in the returned
`StatementIngestResult.warnings` instead of blocking — that list IS the
review surface until a persisted one exists, mirroring every prior
transport slice's "no real caller yet" honesty.
