"""The refund-estimate funnel (G4.8; `BA_fleet_fuel.md` §2.3's `/estimate`
row, R43, R53).

*"Upload last quarter → see your refund opportunity."* A prospect hands over a
fuel-card statement; this parses it in memory and says roughly how much VAT is
sitting in it, per refund country, with the Art. 17 minimum flagged.

WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER INTAKE PATH
--------------------------------------------------------
It writes NOTHING. `statement_ingest` exists to turn a statement into
`fuel_transactions` rows that a claim is eventually built from; this turns the
same bytes into a number on a screen and then forgets them. R43 states the rule
verbatim — **in-memory only, no product-DB write** — and the reason is not
tidiness: a sales preview that quietly created rows would put a prospect's data
into a workspace's real tables before anyone decided to become a customer.
`test_wo_ac_estimate.py` asserts the absence directly rather than trusting this
docstring.

The one DB access here is `fx.to_eur`, which READS the ECB rate cache. A read
is not a write, and the alternative — carrying a second conversion path — is
the thing this codebase refuses everywhere else.

WHY `recoverable_eur` IS SIMPLY THE INVOICED VAT
--------------------------------------------------
§2.3, verbatim: `recoverable_eur = vat_eur`, *"invoiced VAT assumed
recoverable"*. That is a deliberately generous assumption and it is what makes
this a SALES PREVIEW and not a filing: the real pipeline applies supplier
registration (R15), the receipt-control gate, the document gate, waivers,
Art. 17 minimums and the fee before a euro is claimable. Every one of those can
only reduce the figure. The estimate therefore reads as an upper bound, and
`CAVEAT` says so on every response — R53's *"indicative / advisory — verify
before relying"*, which that rule forbids flattening into the language used for
a contractual claim-back.

WHAT THE PARSER ALREADY GUARANTEES, SO THIS MODULE DOES NOT RE-CHECK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Every shipped parser validates the country and currency codes structurally and
raises on a bad one (`eurowag.py`: *"row 2: invalid country code ''"*), which
refuses the WHOLE file. An earlier draft of this module carried its own
"a line with no country is counted as unattributable" branch; it was dead code,
and worse than dead — counting such a line would have been a quieter, weaker
answer than the refusal the parser already gives. The funnel inherits that
guarantee rather than re-implementing a softer version of it.

WHY A LINE THAT CANNOT BE CONVERTED IS COUNTED, NOT DROPPED
--------------------------------------------------------------
`fx.to_eur` returns `None` when no ECB rate exists for that currency and date —
never a guessed number (`app/models/fx.py`'s platform-wide rule). A funnel that
silently skipped those lines would report a smaller opportunity than the file
contains and give no sign it had done so, which is the failure mode that turns
a sales tool into a misleading one. Unconvertible lines are counted in
`unconverted_lines` and named in the warnings, so the number is always
accompanied by what it could not see.

WHY `below_minimum` CAN BE `None`
-----------------------------------
`minimum.below_minimum` compares in the CORRECT currency for the country —
`vat_local` for Sweden and Denmark, `vat_eur` for everyone else. A country
whose lines arrive in more than one currency has no single `vat_local` to
compare, so the honest answer is "not compared", not `False`. Three states,
never two collapsed: `True` (below), `False` (clears it), `None` (could not
tell). The same discipline `excise.py` applies to a missing rate versus a
placeholder one.
