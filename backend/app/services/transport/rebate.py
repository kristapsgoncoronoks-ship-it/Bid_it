"""The OFF-INVOICE rebate layer — recording it, merging it into `net_eur_eff`,
and guarding its source (G4.2; R50; `BA_fleet_fuel.md` §4.2, §5.1, §2.5).

THE HARVESTED DEFINITION, VERBATIM
-----------------------------------
`BA_fleet_fuel.md` §4.2's *"`net_eur_eff` — the two-tier discount model (a
business rule, not a technicality)"*:

    "**On-invoice** discounts (TFC hub discount -0.205/L, E100 station-colour
     tiers 0.08-0.23/L, MOEVE PRN off pump PVP, DKV 1.30 SEK/L + 5.63% service
     fee) are already inside `net_eur`.
     **Off-invoice** rebates land ONLY in `net_eur_eff`. **The canonical case is
     Q8/Port One:** Q8 invoices at **LIST price** per country; Port One issues a
     **SEPARATE rebate invoice per country**. The pair must always be
     reconciled. This is the entire reason the `net_eur_eff` column exists."

and R50: *"**`net_eur_eff` carries off-invoice rebate layers** … **Guard the
input source** so a raw file cannot silently replace an adjusted one."*
Acceptance: *"Feed the un-adjusted source ⇒ the pipeline **fails or warns
loudly**, it does not silently produce list-price analytics."*

WHAT WAS ACTUALLY TRUE BEFORE THIS MODULE
-------------------------------------------
`net_eur_eff` had exactly one writer — `fuel_ingest.ingest_transaction`'s
`q2(net_eur_eff if net_eur_eff is not None else net_eur)` — and no production
caller ever passed a value: `statement_ingest` omits the argument and all seven
parsers say in as many words that the merge is G4.2's. So `net_eur_eff` was an
exact copy of `net_eur` on every stored row, while `contract_audit._breach_for`
already read it as though a merge had happened. Its `applied = eur_l_doc -
eur_l_eff` term was therefore identically zero and its `short discount` flag
over-claimed by the WHOLE contracted rebate — a figure `overcharge.open_claim`
freezes and `overcharge_pack.build_claim_letter` prints in a 30-day payment
demand. This module is what makes that arithmetic true.

THE TWO HALVES OF THE SOURCE GUARD
------------------------------------
§4.2 states the hazard R50 guards against: *"the Q8 rebate layer depends on
`month_config.FILES["Q8"]` pointing at the *adjusted* workbook. There is no
assertion that it does — swapping in the raw file **silently loses the rebate
layer**, corrupting every price/benchmark/overpay figure."* Two failure modes,
two answers:

1. **A rebate must never be INFERRED.** `merge_period` reads recorded
   `VatOffInvoiceRebate` rows and nothing else — there is no code path here
   that derives, estimates or carries a rebate forward. `record_rebate` refuses
   a blank `source_ref`/`source_party` (fail-CLOSED, `rebate_source_required`)
   before any query, and the table repeats both as `CHECK`s.
2. **A rebate layer must never silently DISAPPEAR.** That is a question about a
   period with NO recorded row, so no constraint can answer it.
   `missing_source_warnings` does, and the expectation is learned from history
   exactly as §2.5's "Expected rebate" row prescribes: *"Learns the typical €/L
   rebate per (supplier, country) from all history; flags a line where it is
   **missing** … Rationale: catches rebates that arrive on a **separate invoice
   we often don't see** (the Q8/Port One case)."* A `(supplier, country)` with a
   recorded source in an EARLIER period, litres in THIS period and no source for
   it is precisely "the raw file was swapped in".

Per master-context §4.19 that warning is ADVISORY — it never blocks and changes
no euro. R50 says *"fails **or** warns loudly"*: this module warns at the
analytics surface and FAILS everywhere a wrong figure would otherwise be
written (see "fail-closed refusals" below).

THE ALLOCATION — A DOCUMENTED INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------------------
The spec gives the LAYER but no allocation formula: a rebate invoice is one
lump per (country, period) while `net_eur_eff` is per line. This module states
its rule rather than guessing one (the same discipline as `contract_audit`'s
most-specific-wins term tie-break):

    **pro-rata by `qty` (litres).**

Three reasons, all checkable: (a) §5.1's rebate vocabulary is uniformly €/L
(0.08-0.23/L, 0.205/L, 1.30 SEK/L) — a fuel rebate is a per-litre instrument;
(b) it makes `applied = eur_l_doc - eur_l_eff` a CONSTANT €/L across the
country's lines, which is the shape `contract_audit` compares against a €/L
`expected_discount_eur_l`; (c) a value-weighted alternative would make `applied`
vary with the pump price and so manufacture short-discount findings on exactly
the expensive lines. Lines with `qty == 0` (§4.2 row 9's promo corrections)
receive nothing — they have no litres to rebate.

ROUNDING (§4.9) — WHY THE ALLOCATION IS CUMULATIVE
----------------------------------------------------
Quantizing each line's share independently loses or invents cents: the shares
would not sum to the recorded rebate, and the difference would silently become
an unexplained euro on a price surface. Instead the allocation walks the lines
in `line_seq` order carrying a CUMULATIVE litre count and quantizes the running
total:

    cum_eur_i = q2(rebate_total * cum_qty_i / total_qty)
    share_i   = cum_eur_i - cum_eur_(i-1)

so `Σ share_i == rebate_total` EXACTLY, by construction, with one `q2`
(ROUND_HALF_UP) per line and no residual fudge. Every value is `Decimal`; `qty`
stays un-quantized (§4.2 row 9 / master-context §4.9's own €/L-denominator
carve-out).

IDEMPOTENCY — RECOMPUTE FROM `net_eur`, NEVER FROM `net_eur_eff`
------------------------------------------------------------------
`merge_period` always derives the new effective net from the AS-INVOICED
`net_eur`, never from the column's current value. That one rule is what makes
re-running the close a no-op: the second run computes the same figures, finds
every row already equal, writes nothing and audits nothing. It is also what
makes a recorded-rebate CORRECTION self-healing — the next close simply
recomputes from the invoiced net with the corrected rebate, rather than
compounding a delta onto an already-adjusted figure.

WHO IS ALLOWED TO WRITE THE FIGURE (§3.H, the engine boundary)
----------------------------------------------------------------
`record_rebate` is web-reachable and writes ONLY the rebate registry — it never
touches a transaction. The merge itself is a CLOSE STAGE (`close.run_close`),
because `net_eur_eff` on an already-validated transaction is product data the
ENGINE owns; a web request must not mutate it. A merge refusal propagates to
`jobs.run_once`'s whole-session rollback, which is what makes "halts on the
first failure, nothing partially applied" literal for free (see `close.py`'s
docstring).

FAIL-CLOSED REFUSALS (resolved BEFORE any write — the `statement_ingest`
two-phase guarantee: a refused merge leaves ZERO rows changed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- `rebate_has_no_transactions` — a rebate recorded against a (supplier, country,
  period) with no lines. The rebate would vanish; vanishing is the disappearance
  R50 exists to prevent.
- `rebate_no_litres_to_allocate` — every line of that country has `qty == 0`.
  There is nothing to allocate per litre and silently dropping the rebate is the
  same disappearance.
- `rebate_exceeds_net` — an allocated share that would drive a line's effective
  net to zero or below. A non-positive effective net corrupts every €/L computed
  from it, and a rebate bigger than the invoiced net is a data error, not a
  discount.

§4.14 — WHY NO CROSS-CURRENCY SUM CAN HAPPEN HERE
---------------------------------------------------
`merge_period` totals `amount_eur` only. A rebate that cannot reach EUR is
refused at RECORDING (`fx_rate_unavailable`, §4.15), so a non-EUR figure can
never enter the sum — the same structural argument `contract_audit` makes about
`net_eur`.

    one", stated as a warning per §2.5's "Expected rebate" rationale.

    A `(supplier, country)` is EXPECTED to carry an off-invoice rebate layer once
    one has ever been recorded for it — the expectation is learned from history,
    which is §2.5's own mechanism (*"Learns the typical €/L rebate per (supplier,
    country) from all history; flags a line where it is missing … catches rebates
    that arrive on a separate invoice we often don't see"*). This function flags
    the pair when it has litres in `period` and NO recorded source for it.

    ADVISORY (§4.19): it returns strings. It blocks nothing, gates nothing and
    changes no figure — it exists so that R50's *"it does not silently produce
    list-price analytics"* is literally true at the surface that produces them
    (`contract_audit.audit`, which carries these on its result).

    Fails toward SILENCE for a supplier that has never had a rebate layer: with
    no history there is no expectation, and crying wolf on every ordinary
    supplier would train an operator to ignore the one warning that matters.
