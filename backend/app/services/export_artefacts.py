"""PROD-009 — destroying export bytes once their link is dead.

Found while building the whole-workspace export: NOTHING ever deleted a
produced export zip. WO-AI stored its archive zip in the `exports` document
class, handed out a link that expires after seven days, and then kept the bytes
for ever. The `exports` prefix appears in exactly two places in the codebase —
the store and the load — and in neither is there a delete. So a workspace that
asked for an export every month accumulated a copy of its own data every month,
each one readable by anyone who could read the bucket, long after the only
credential that pointed at it had expired.

That was a small leak while an export was one table. It is not small now that
an export is the whole workspace, so this runs daily for every tenant, beside
the recycle-bin and archive purges:

  a request whose link has expired, or which has already been downloaded and
  sat for `GRACE`, loses its bytes. The ROW stays — the request, its size, its
  counts and now its `purged_at` are the record that an export happened, and
  that record is what an audit asks for. Only the copy of the data goes.

Bytes first, then the mark (WO-V's rule: an object whose row says it is gone
must really be gone), and both request tables are answered by the same pass.
