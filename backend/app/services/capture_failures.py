"""The failed-capture worklist (H-1) — a typed outcome contract for a capture
that did not become an invoice, and the queue an operator works it from.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Before this module a failed capture was reachable only by polling
`GET /invoices/upload/{run_id}` — which requires already knowing the id. Nothing
enumerated failures for a tenant. `extraction.pending_review_filters` covers the
*parsed* queue only. The result is the worst shape a document pipeline can take:
the customer believes the document was processed, and it was not, and no screen
disagrees.

THE CONTRACT
------------
A failure is recorded as a STABLE CODE from the closed vocabulary in `KINDS`,
never as free-form prose. The raw error message is still kept (it is what an
engineer needs) but it is not what the operator is shown: each code carries a
`summary` of what happened and a `remediation` sentence telling them what to DO.
An error a user cannot act on sends them to support, so `retry_helps` and
`user_fixable` are part of the contract rather than something a screen guesses.

`code_for` maps an exception to a code. It classifies on the exception *type*
(`CaptureError.code`, raised at the specific known sites), never by matching
words in a message — a classifier that reads prose breaks silently the day
someone rewords a message. What we genuinely cannot classify becomes
`internal_error`, and rows written before this module existed report
`unknown_failure`. Neither invents a cause.

WHAT SUCCEEDED
--------------
A failure statement that says only "failed" is incomplete: the uploaded document
IS retained (object storage, keyed by sha256) in every failure mode except the
one where the stored copy is what went missing. `WorklistItem.document_retained`
says so explicitly, because "we lost your reading of the file" and "we lost your
file" are very different sentences to the person who sent it.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
---------------
Acknowledging is a RECORD (who, when, an optional note), not a boolean — an
append-only `capture_acknowledgements` row. It is also scoped in TIME: the ack
stores the failure timestamp it was made against, so a capture that fails AGAIN
after being acknowledged returns to the worklist instead of staying silently
dismissed.

Read-only over the two capture channels; this module never re-runs a capture and
never mutates a draft.
