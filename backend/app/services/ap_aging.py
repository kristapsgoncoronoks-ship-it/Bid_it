"""Accounts-payable aging worklist + due-date alerting (Phase 16b).

The AP counterpart of the AR dunning ladder: a per-invoice worklist of open
payables (approved → scheduled → partially-paid supplier invoices), each tagged
with its settlement `status`, days overdue, and an aging/`due_soon` bucket, plus a
roll-up used by the daily due-date digest. Read-only over the AP status derivation
(services/ap_status); writes nothing. Tenant-scoped.
