"""A durable, DB-backed job queue with at-most-one-worker claim + retries.

Rows in the `jobs` table ARE the queue. This module is the whole contract:

  enqueue()      append a job (idempotent when an idempotency_key is given)
  claim()        atomically lease the oldest ready job to one worker
  run_once()     claim → dispatch to the registered handler → complete/fail
  reclaim_stale() return jobs whose worker died (stale lease) to the queue

Design goals: portable (SQLite + Postgres), idempotent (a re-enqueue with the
same key is a no-op; a handler that runs twice must be safe), and never-lost (a
crashed worker's job is reclaimed, a failing job retries with exponential
backoff and finally lands in the `dead` dead-letter state).

Handlers register with @handler("kind") and receive (db, payload, job). The job
runs INSIDE its tenant's scope (org context is set around dispatch) so handler
queries and audit attribution are tenant-correct.
