"""PROD-009 — the whole-workspace data export.

The audit's finding was that a customer could put everything into this platform
and had no way to take it out again: the only export that existed read ONE
table (`archived_invoices`, WO-AI) for a client who had already left. This is
the other half — a live owner asking for everything the workspace holds, so
that leaving is a decision rather than a threat.

**Driven off the registry, never a hand-written list.** The set of tables is
`core.tenant.TENANT_MODELS` (the same registry the ORM tenant guard and the RLS
set-equality test are held to) plus the two child tables that carry no `org_id`
of their own and are reached through an already-scoped parent. A table added to
the product is therefore in the export the day it is registered, and
`tests/test_prod009_workspace_export.py` asserts the two sets are equal in both
directions — a hand-written list would have been a promise that silently rots.

**Credentials never leave.** Every column whose name matches `_SECRET_NAME` is
written as `null` with its name listed in the manifest's `redacted`, unless it
appears in `_NOT_SECRET` with a stated reason. The audit chain's own hashes are
the one such exception: they are the proof the trail was not edited, and an
export without them could not be verified by anyone.

**Bounded, and honest when it cannot be.** The zip is built into a temporary
file, one table and one document at a time, so building it does not hold the
workspace in memory. Storing it does: `core.storage` is content-addressed and
its `put` takes bytes, so the finished file is read once. That read is the
ceiling — `settings.workspace_export_max_bytes` — and an export that would
exceed it FAILS with the size in the message rather than taking the worker down
(EXPORT-001 in the findings register: a streaming `put` would remove the
ceiling, and is a storage-layer change, not this one).

Delivery reuses WO-AI's rails exactly: the artefact goes to the `exports`
document class, the owner gets a ONE-TIME `EmailToken` link (purpose
`workspace_export`, seven days), opening it consumes it. Unlike WO-AI there is
NO public door: a whole-workspace dump of a live tenant is reachable only by an
authenticated owner of that tenant.
