"""Defense-in-depth tenant isolation (application-level row security).

Per-route `org_id` filters are the first line of defence; this is the second.
A request-scoped `ContextVar` holds the caller's org, and a `do_orm_execute`
hook automatically ANDs `org_id == <current org>` onto every SELECT that touches
a tenant-scoped model — so even a query that forgets to filter cannot return
another tenant's rows.

Portable (SQLite + Postgres). For belt-and-braces at the database layer,
Postgres RLS is the recommended additional hardening (see docs/SECURITY note).

Scoping is bypassed (context = None) for:
  • bootstrap / unauthenticated paths (register, login, accept-invite),
  • platform-operator routes that intentionally read across tenants.

    built on ``model``'s own columns and the class identity is resolved through
    the mapper; a class without an ``org_id`` column — or the wrapper

    inspection ON PURPOSE: the guard's callable may only call functions that
    return SQL elements (SQLAlchemy's lambda analysis refuses a call whose
    result is a plain Python value, `inspect()` included).

    Every tenant model scopes by its own `org_id` — except `User` (B1.5): a
    person can belong to several orgs, so `users.org_id` is only the ACTIVE-ORG
    pointer (repointed by org-switching), never a membership assertion. The

    — a member whose active org is elsewhere stays visible to their other orgs
    (SCIM roster, reimbursement payees, approver resolution, GDPR scans), while
    a non-member remains at zero rows. Membership *status* is deliberately not

    """ONE loader-criteria option covering the whole tenant registry, built once
    per org (PERF-019, reference integration R5).

    Until R5 this returned one option PER MODEL — 103 of them on every SELECT
    the process issued. SQLAlchemy regenerates a statement's cache key over
    all of its options on every execute, and that key generation was
    measured at roughly half of every request's loop time
    (`docs/perf/TENANT-GUARD-2026-09-08.md`). One option on the declarative
    `Base` applies to every mapped class; the callable decides per class, BY
    ATTRIBUTE through the mapper, what the predicate is: the org column for
    a class whose mapper has an `org_id` column, the membership-existence
    predicate for `User` (`_scope_criteria`), nothing (`true()`) for a class
    without `org_id`. That set is exactly the registry (below), so the
    scoped models are the same as before; the registry itself is now the
    on/off switch and this cache's key, not the per-class lookup. The
    callable receives the ALIAS for an aliased entity, so class identity is
    resolved through `inspect(cls).mapper` and the predicate is built on the
    alias's own columns (the R5 panel found `aliased(User)` getting the
    active-org pointer instead of membership when the check was `is User`).

    The org id enters the callable as a TYPED BIND PARAMETER created outside
    it. That is the one safe way to use the callable form: SQLAlchemy's
    lambda analysis makes the option's cache key structural and carries the
    parameter's VALUE with each execution, so two tenants share one compiled
    statement and never each other's rows (proved by
    `tests/test_tenant_guard_mechanism.py`: the two options' statement cache
    keys are EQUAL while their extracted bind values differ, and alternating
    orgs in one process return each org's rows — the row assertions are the
    proof; a flat compiled cache alone would not detect a baked-in tenant).
    The bind name is reserved (`_tenant_guard_org`): an application bind of
    the same name would be overwritten silently. A bare closure variable is refused by
    SQLAlchemy outright, and `track_closure_variables=False` would bake the
    first tenant in — the cross-tenant leak the previous docstring warned
    about, and still the reason for the bind parameter.

    Cached on the org id — the option holds that org's parameter value — and
    bounded, because an unbounded cache keyed by tenant is a slow memory leak
    in a multi-tenant process.

    The callable closes over ONLY that parameter. SQLAlchemy's lambda analysis
    instruments every closure cell AND every literal-valued module global the
    callable names (functions and classes such as `inspect`, `true`,
    `_scope_criteria` are left alone — that is why the callable works at
    all): a `BindParameter` is tracked and its value extracted per
    execution; a plain Python object (the registry tuple was tried — it was
    wrapped as a bound value and `cls in <param>` failed) is not usable; and a
    value hidden from the analysis (a default argument was tried) is baked
    into the compiled statement for good, which served the first tenant's
    rows to the second — caught by
    `test_two_tenants_share_one_compiled_statement_and_never_rows`. So the
    per-class decision is made by ATTRIBUTE: a class with `org_id` is
    scoped, one without is not. That set is exactly the registry —
    `tests/test_tenant_registration.py` fails when a model grows `org_id`
    without being registered, `tests/test_rls.py` when the RLS table list
    drifts from it — so the registry remains the one list, and it keeps its
    on/off role here: `models` is a parameter so it is part of this cache's
    KEY, and an empty registry attaches nothing, which is how
    `tests/test_tenancy_parity.py` neutralises layer 2 to prove its own
    probe can fail.

# model cannot cross tenants. RLS reads the current org from a per-transaction
# GUC, `app.current_org`, which we keep in sync with the ContextVar here.
#
# Policy contract (see the migration): when `app.current_org` is UNSET *or the
# empty string* the policy passes all rows — matching the app's "org is None
# ⇒ intentionally unscoped" semantics for bootstrap / platform-operator /
# worker-claim paths. When it is SET to a real org id, rows are restricted to
# that org. The scoped path (a normal authenticated request) always sets it,
# so that is where RLS bites.
#
# WHY both NULL and '': a per-transaction `set_config(..., true)` (`SET
# LOCAL`) never restores a custom GUC to SQL NULL once ANY transaction on that
# physical connection has set it — COMMIT, RESET, and an explicit
# `set_config(name, NULL, true)` all leave it at `''` instead, for the rest of
# that connection's life (confirmed empirically on Postgres 16; see ADR-0028
# and `tests/test_rls_connection_reuse.py`). So a connection a prior request
# scoped is NEVER NULL again — only a virgin connection is. Every RLS policy
# therefore treats both as "unscoped" (WO-27); relying on NULL alone silently
# hid rows for any unscoped/re-authenticating request on a warmed, reused
# connection, which is every connection under any real pool/load.
