"""Wire schemas for the off-invoice rebate registry (WO-84, G4.2/R50).

Field-for-field from `app/models/transport/off_invoice_rebate.py`'s columns —
this module shapes the wire and computes nothing (engineering-rules §3). In
particular it does NOT accept `amount_eur`: the EUR figure is RESOLVED by the
service through `fx.to_eur` at the document's own date and refused when no rate
exists (master-context §4.10 "the server recomputes every total", §4.15 "never a
guessed number"). A client states the document; the server states the euro.

Every amount is typed `Decimal`, so pydantic v2 serializes it as a JSON STRING
and no float ever appears in a money path (§4.9).

`source_ref` and `source_party` carry `min_length=1` here as a SHAPE check only.
The real guard is `rebate._require_source`, which strips first (so `"  "` is
refused too) and raises the service's own `rebate_source_required`, and the
`CHECK` constraints on the table behind it. The schema catches shape; the
service catches the business rule (definition-of-done §3).
