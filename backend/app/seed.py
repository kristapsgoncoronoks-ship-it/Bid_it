    Research-backed rules (docs/design/demo-dataset.md): all identities are
    SYNTHETIC-SAFE — emails only at IANA-held example.com, IBANs mod-97-valid
    on the fictitious `BANK` code, 9-prefixed LV VAT numbers outside the real
    register's ranges, +371 5-series phones (unassignable). All dates are
    RELATIVE to today so the demo never stales, imperfect states are planted
    on purpose (a stale offer, an overdue invoice, a dormant customer), and
    everything flows through the SERVICE layer where invariants and audit
    trails live — the demo workspace is built the way a real one is used.

    """Advance every seeded AP invoice through the REAL review -> approval ->
    payment-run endpoint FUNCTIONS (not a hand-set enum), so `workflow_state` —
    what cash-position/payment-runs/the dashboard actually read — never diverges
    from the legacy aging `status` the Invoices list badge reads (R3,
    docs/plan/plan-a/wo/WO-28-R3.md). These are plain `async def`s: FastAPI's
    Depends/Annotated machinery only activates through the real HTTP dispatcher,
    so calling them directly with `current=owner, db=db` runs the exact same
    body (audit records, webhook emit, best-effort mailer.send) with zero
    network I/O, since the fresh demo org has no webhook endpoints and
    `settings.smtp_enabled` defaults False.

    The demo owner (`is_platform_admin=True`) is the ONLY user in the demo org,
    so the payment-run maker<>checker control (WO-9) is satisfied via the SAME
    explicit, audited `override_sod=True` path a real single-admin org would
    use — never a silent bypass; every override is recorded to the audit log
    exactly as it would be for a live customer."""
