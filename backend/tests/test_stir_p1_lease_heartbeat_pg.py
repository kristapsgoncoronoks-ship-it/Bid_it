"""STIR-P1-01 (Stirling-PDF, reference integration 2026-09-07) — the lease
heartbeat on Postgres, under row-level security, with the handler's own
transaction open.

The SQLite tests prove the logic; this proves the two things only Postgres can:

  1. the renewal runs on a SEPARATE connection while the worker's session holds
     an open transaction on the same row's table (a real handler does), and
     neither blocks the other — no lock wait, no deadlock, no serialization
     failure;
  2. the renewal's own session is scoped to the job's tenant, so the UPDATE
     is visible under FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY (the `jobs` table is in the
     RLS set) and the row it touches is the tenant's own.

Postgres-gated (`RLS_TEST_DATABASE_URL`), like the other PG-only tests.
