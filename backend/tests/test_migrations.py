"""Foundation guard: Alembic migrations are the production schema authority
(create_all is dev/CI only). These tests keep migrations honest:

1. Migrations apply cleanly from an EMPTY database, and downgrade→upgrade
   round-trips — so a broken or non-reversible migration fails the build.
2. The schema produced by running all migrations MATCHES the schema the ORM
   models declare (table + column parity) — so a model change that ships without
   a matching migration is caught in CI, not discovered in production.

Portability note: we compare two databases we both build (models via create_all
vs. migrations via alembic) with the SQLAlchemy inspector, rather than relying on
Alembic autogenerate reflection (which is noisy on SQLite). This is deterministic
and dialect-robust for the table/column parity that matters most.
