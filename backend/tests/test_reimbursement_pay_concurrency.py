"""Postgres-only proof that two truly-concurrent pays of the SAME reimbursement
batch settle it exactly once (WO-Y).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`routes/reimbursements.py::pay_batch` loads the batch `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`
before `mark_paid`, with a comment stating that the lock serialises overlapping
payouts. Nothing tested it. Its twin on the supplier side —
`test_payment_run_pay_concurrency.py` — has carried that proof since WO-9, so
the employee payout rail was the one settlement path in the product whose lock
was an assertion in a comment.

That asymmetry matters more than it looks: this is money leaving the company to
a named person. A second settlement would flip already-`reimbursed` reports a
second time and stamp a second reference over the first, and the batch's own
`version` counter — the optimistic guard the route checks — would have been
bumped twice with only one of the two payments recorded anywhere a human reads.

WHAT IT PROVES
--------------
Two overlapping transactions, released together by a barrier, both take the
route's `with_for_update()` on the batch row. Exactly one pays. The loser
re-reads a `paid` batch after the winner commits and is refused by the
single-shot state gate in `mark_paid`, so its transaction changes NOTHING: no
second reference, no second `version` bump, no report re-stamped.

The lock is a genuine row lock only on Postgres — the SQLite test harness runs
one shared connection, so a SQLite run would pass whether or not the lock were
there, which is worse than not running. It therefore skips on the default suite
and runs in the Postgres CI job via `RLS_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, mirroring
`test_payment_run_pay_concurrency.py` and `test_numbering_concurrency.py`.

Segregation of duties is satisfied deliberately rather than bypassed: the batch
has a maker, and both racers are third parties. A test that tripped the SoD
refusal would report "refused" for the loser while proving nothing about the
lock — the two failures look identical from the outside and only one of them is
the control under test.

EX19 additionally exercises the actual HTTP route transactions for CSV/cancel,
SEPA/cancel and pay/cancel in both commit orders. The original route loader
takes every tested lock; a separate observer proves PostgreSQL blocked the
second requester, then committed column/audit/outbox snapshots prove its
refusal made no writes.

    """The defect WO-Y found while building the proof above.

    `_load` has documented its lock as serialising "pay/cancel" since it was
    written, and the pay route took it — the cancel route did not. That gap is
    not benign, because a plain read does not block: cancel decided "still open"
    in Python, then its UPDATE waited on the payer's row lock, and after the
    payment committed it wrote `cancelled` straight over it and unlinked the
    reports. The result is the worst kind of inconsistency in a payout system —
    reports stamped `reimbursed` with a real bank reference, belonging to a
    batch that says it was never run.

    With both paths locking, the cancel re-reads a `paid` batch and is refused
    by `cancel_batch`'s own state gate.
