"""Docs truth-up insurance (WO-10, deliberately cheap; extended by WO-40/R12).

`README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` once described a ~12-test analytics MVP
against a ~32k-LOC platform — with a bus factor of one, a lying document is
worse than no document. This guard asserts the regenerated front-door docs
exist, don't reassert the known-stale claims, and keep pointing at the real
specification. It is string-level on purpose: anything deeper would itself
drift.

WO-10's truth-up made the docs' prose accurate *once*; by WO-40 (R12) the
hand-written scale numbers (module/page/revision/ADR/CI-job counts) had
silently drifted stale again after ~30 further work orders. The tests below
close that gap: each recomputes its figure straight from the live tree
(filesystem globs, `alembic/versions/`, the ADR directory, the CI workflow
file) and asserts `README.md`'s embedded numbers still match, so a third
drift fails CI instead of waiting for the next manual audit.
