# InvoiceIQ — Generated ER Diagrams (by domain)

> **GENERATED FILE — do not edit by hand.** Derived from the live
> SQLAlchemy metadata by `backend/scripts/gen_erd.py`; the backend CI
> job fails when this file drifts from the models
> (`tests/test_erd_truth.py`). Regenerate with:
> `cd backend && python scripts/gen_erd.py`.
>
> One diagram per domain — the full schema in one picture would be
> illegible. Edges shown inside a diagram are foreign keys whose both
> ends are in the domain; **cross-domain foreign keys** are listed as
> text under each diagram (that coupling reads better as a list). The
> tenancy FK — every tenant table → `organizations` via `org_id`, the
> RLS/guard backbone — is universal and therefore never drawn.
> Companion: [data-model](./data-model.md) (the annotated logical
> model), [diagram-matrix](./diagram-matrix.md) (what we diagram and
> why).
