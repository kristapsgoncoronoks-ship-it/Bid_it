# Execution hub — how to run Plan A or Plan B

Everything needed to execute either plan lives under this folder. **Decide with
`PLAN_A_vs_PLAN_B.md`, then follow ONE of the runbooks below.**

## Execute Plan A (evolve Bid_it)
1. Session recipe: paste `shared/00_MASTER_CONTEXT.md`, then ONE file from `plan-a/wo/`
   (start `WO-01.md`). One work order per session, one concern per PR.
2. Order: WO-1 → WO-2 → WO-3 …; WO-4/5/6/7/8/10 may run in parallel after WO-1
   (see each order's Depends line and `plan-a/wo/00_PART_B_INTRO.md`).
3. After each order: run the matching `shared/REVIEW_PROMPTS.md` role in a FRESH session.
4. Fleet Fuel deletion: run `shared/DECOMMISSION_FLEET_FUEL.md` once (WO-6 Step 1 first).
5. After WO-10 (M0 exit gate): continue with `plan-a/ARCH_plan.md` M1 tasks via
   `shared/WORK_ORDER_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Execute Plan B (greenfield)
1. Owner: name + create the new repository.
2. Follow `plan-b/GREENFIELD_plan.md` §9 ORDER STRICTLY: new repo → copy this whole
   `docs/plan/` tree into it → PII deny-list while old repos readable → archive BOTH
   repos (Part F, twice) → delete both.
3. Session recipe: paste `shared/00_MASTER_CONTEXT.md` + ONE file from `plan-b/wo/`
   (start `G-01.md` — it also regenerates the master context's facts appendix for the
   new repo). G-orders run strictly in sequence G-1 → G-10.
4. Reviews after each order as in Plan A. After G-10: M2 onward per
   `GREENFIELD_plan.md` §7 via the template.

## Rules that apply to both
- The 20 invariants in `shared/00_MASTER_CONTEXT.md` are non-negotiable.
- PII quarantine (`shared/VAT_HARVEST.md` E.0) binds ALL copies/archives of the old
  repos, forever.
- Never claim done without pasted command output (definition of done, Part A).
