# TODO — Task Board

Live board per the founder's charter (statuses: `Backlog` · `Planned` · `In Progress` · `Blocked` ·
`Testing` · `Review` · `Completed`). Supersedes the 2026-07-27 audit snapshot preserved at the bottom
of this file — every P0/P1/P2 item it listed as `Approved`/`Backlog` is now closed. This file is the
current source of truth; `docs/M0-exit-gate.md` and `docs/plan/plan-a/wo/` (WO-1…47) are the detailed
per-order record.

**Plan:** Plan A (evolve Bid_it) — decided 2026-07-25, reaffirmed 2026-07-28. See
`docs/plan/PLAN_A_vs_PLAN_B.md`. Plan B (`docs/plan/plan-b/GREENFIELD_plan.md`) was considered and set
aside; not executed.

## Milestone status

| Milestone | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Security/correctness debt sprint | ✅ **Completed** — WO-1…11 (incl. B1.5). All 12 exit-gate criteria met. See `docs/M0-exit-gate.md`. |
| **M1** | Feature completion + independent audit | ✅ **Completed** — WO-12…46. Every named epic shipped; 18-item audit (R1–R19) closed except two decision-gated/backlog items (below). |
| **M2** | "We can take money" — billing go-live | 🔶 **In Progress** — WO-47 shipped (quota model fixed). Three items owner-blocked (below). |
| M3 | Transport vertical phase 1 — VAT refund claim engine | `Planned` |
| M4 | Payments & cash depth | `Planned` |
| M5 | Transport vertical phase 2 — recovery intelligence | `Planned` |
| M6 | Integrations & enterprise go-live | `Planned` |

**Test suite:** 761 → 1157 passed (+396), 8 skipped (pg-only, verified separately on real Postgres), 0 known regressions, as of `a124538`.

## M2 — In Progress

- [x] **WO-47** — `Completed` — Quota/usage-limit model now keys off the org's `plan`
  (`app.services.plans.PLANS`), not the acting user's role (the plan flagged this as must-fix
  "before the first invoice, not after") — every member of an org shares one org-wide cap;
  `role_policies`→`plan_policies`. Preserves the never-lose-a-document-on-limit guardrail (every
  quota check still runs before anything is persisted; block-at-the-cap, since auto-charge overage
  needs live billing, still owner-blocked). Detail: `docs/plan/plan-a/wo/WO-47-H13.md`.

### M2 — Blocked on owner/business decisions (not code-blocked; tracked in `docs/DECISIONS-NEEDED.md`)

- [ ] **Stripe live** — Checkout, Billing Portal, signed webhook, Billing Meter. Needs production
  Stripe credentials from the owner. Fallback available: AR-module dogfood invoicing — revenue is not
  blocked on this.
- [ ] **Seller-of-record VAT process** — Stripe Tax vs. an explicit alternative; a finance decision.
- [ ] **Plan ladder reconciliation (H1.2)** — code implements trial/starter/pro/enterprise
  (€0/€29/€99/custom); the pricing hypothesis doc proposes a different Free/€39/€99/€249/Enterprise +
  Practice ladder. They conflict; the owner must pick one. WO-47's quota fix already uses whichever
  ladder is live in code today (indicative defaults, sysadmin-overridable) — this decision changes
  only `plans.py::PLANS`, not the enforcement mechanism. `docs/DECISIONS-NEEDED.md` §2a.

## M1 — Completed (WO-12…46)

Epics F1.1 (master-data/document screens) · C1.5–C1.9 (currency/dimension registries, multi-currency
reporting, dead-state removal, reclaimable-VAT fix) · I1.1–I1.3/I1.5 (composed dashboard, grouped nav
IA, honest cash-position label, report writers) · A1.5 (8 business roles reachable) · E1.1–E1.7
(capture-review UI, line-item provenance, hash re-upload detection, Mailgun adapter, extraction
learning loop) — all shipped, tested, documented. Full list: `docs/plan/plan-a/wo/WO-12*.md` through
`WO-46*.md`.

### UX/UI redesign audit — Phase 1 complete, implementation started

- [x] **Audit** — `Completed` — `docs/design/UX-AUDIT.md`. Verdict: the WO-17 grouped sidebar nav is
  already good, do not rebuild; two CRITICAL findings (silent-failure async states on 26 pages;
  unlabeled form controls, WCAG 1.3.1/4.1.2) and one HIGH (design system built but ~unused —
  migration, not new-build).
- [ ] **WO-45-UX1** — `Planned` — fix `QueryState`'s error branch, adopt `QueryState`+`PageHeader` on
  the 8 money-bearing pages, unclip the Invoices table, add a focus ring to `.btn`. Fully specified,
  not yet implemented: `docs/plan/plan-a/wo/WO-45-UX1-async-state-and-page-header.md`.
- [ ] Further UX slices (design-system migration across remaining pages, form-label pass, nav collapse
  rail/group-collapse/breadcrumbs, orphaned-route wiring for `/issuer` and `/reimbursements`) —
  `Backlog`, scoped in `docs/design/UX-AUDIT.md`'s phased plan, to be written up as WO-48+ in turn.

## Historical note

Everything below this line is the original 2026-07-27 audit snapshot, preserved for traceability. Every
item on it is now closed or reclassified above — do not treat it as current; the tables above supersede
it entirely. The original per-item detail sections it links to remain live in `docs/audit/`.

<details>
<summary>Original 2026-07-27 board (click to expand — superseded)</summary>

This board is seeded from the Phase 1-11 independent 4-agent SaaS review board audit (see
`docs/audit/`, run on branch `claude/bidit-invoice-data-analytics`, 2026-07-27). It reflects the
**debate-adjusted** priorities in `docs/audit/remediation-roadmap.md`. Every P0/P1 item starts as
**Approved** (ready for a work order); every P2 starts as **Backlog**; P3/P4 items are also
**Backlog** (lower priority, schedule opportunistically). No disputed/rejected findings occurred in
this audit round — see `docs/audit/agent-debate.md`'s "Disputed / rejected findings" section.

Statuses: `Backlog` · `Approved` · `In Progress` · `Blocked` · `Testing` · `Review` · `Completed` · `Rejected`

Implementation of these items is explicitly **out of scope for this pass** — each item becomes its own
future work order (WO-26+), reviewed one change at a time, matching the WO-1..WO-25 pattern already used
in this repo (see `git log` / `docs/plan/`).

### P0 — blocks any pilot (Approved)

- [x] **R2** — Credit-note creation has no row lock, violating the codebase's own non-negotiable
  invariant on over-crediting (reproduced live). Evidence: `docs/audit/functional-audit.md` §2.1,
  `docs/audit/agent-debate.md` §1.
- [x] **R3** — Demo/seed data self-contradicts: Cash Position/Payment Runs show €0 owed while
  Invoices lists >€1M. Evidence: `docs/audit/commercial-readiness.md` §3, `docs/audit/agent-debate.md` §8.

### P1 — blocks general (self-serve) release (Approved)

- [x] **R1** — CSV formula-injection sanitization inconsistently applied across 3 financial exports.
  Evidence: `docs/audit/functional-audit.md` §3.1, `docs/audit/security-findings.md` §2.4.
- [x] **R4** — Expense-approval decision has no optimistic-concurrency guard or row lock.
  Evidence: `docs/audit/test-baseline.md` finding #2.
- [ ] **R5** — Self-serve billing collects zero real payment today; Enterprise tier is self-upgradable
  for free even with billing wired (`price_eur=None` bypass). Split: the free-upgrade bypass closed
  (WO-31); the "collects zero real payment" half is owner-blocked, tracked under M2 above.
  Evidence: `docs/audit/commercial-readiness.md` §7.

### P2 — should fix before general release (Backlog)

- [x] **R6** — Reimbursement payout had no maker≠checker (SoD) control.
- [x] **R7** — ClamAV fail-closed malware-scan branch had zero test coverage.
- [ ] **R14** — No application-owned backup/restore tooling exists; decision-gated. Still open —
  tracked above.
- [x] **R16** — AR "Issue" screen: destructive actions had no confirmation dialog.
- [x] **R18** — Billing downgrade silently disabled modules with no confirmation.

### P3 — backlog / hardening (Backlog)

- [x] **R8** — OIDC `discover()`/`fetch_jwks()` had no SSRF guard.
- [x] **R9** — Duplicate CSV-sanitization helper implemented 3x.
- [x] **R13** — `test_fx.py::test_refresh_owner_only_and_graceful` didn't actually test "owner only."
- [ ] **R15** — No load/concurrency/large-dataset performance testing harness. Still open — tracked above.
- [x] **R17** — Payment-run "Cancel" button fired with no confirmation.
- [ ] **R19** — No guided onboarding/setup-wizard checklist. Still open — tracked above.

### P4 — informational / doc hygiene (Backlog)

- [x] **R10** — `LocalStorage._path` containment check used bare `startswith`.
- [x] **R11** — Stale `# TODO: secret store` comment on `SsoConnection.client_secret`.
- [x] **R12** — Root `README.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` were stale.

### Verified controls — no action required (not tasks; recorded for traceability)

These were raised during the audit (some at P1) but resolved through adversarial debate as
**confirmations of existing strength**, not defects — see `docs/audit/agent-debate.md` and
`docs/audit/remediation-roadmap.md`'s "Verified controls" section:

- Tenant isolation (query filter + ORM guard + Postgres RLS with FORCE) — independently reproduced
  live against a real Postgres cluster twice.
- Structural, CI-gated route authorization (`test_authz_coverage.py`) — recommend keeping this a
  required, unfiltered CI gate.
- Upload/attachment security gate (`filesec.py`) — covers all 8 intake paths, live exploit tests pass.
- `docs/plan/plan-a/ARCH_plan.md`'s prior risk claims (vendors/partners authz, route-level
  `_reconcile`, hardcoded EUR) were stale/false against source at audit time — since superseded by the
  banner fix (2026-07-28); the document is current again.

*Backlog items predating this audit, if any existed at the repo root, are preserved in
`docs/BACKLOG.md` (pre-existing) — this file is the audit-derived task board and does not duplicate or
supersede that doc; see `docs/BACKLOG.md` for other in-flight work not covered by this audit round.*
